# Diabetes Prediction System

This project focuses on building a system that can predict whether a person has diabetes or not with the help of Machine Learning. The entire project is implemented in Python, leveraging the power of Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for prediction.

## Overview

Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and management of diabetes can significantly improve a person's quality of life. In this project, we aim to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify whether an individual has diabetes based on certain features such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, etc.

## Implementation

The implementation of this project is carried out entirely in Python programming language. We utilize popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, model training, and visualization.

### Tools and Libraries Used:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Getting Started

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

3. Open the main Python notebook (`Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb`) in your preferred Python environment.
4. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to execute the code and train the Support Vector Machine model.
5. Once the model is trained, you can use it for prediction on new diabetes-related data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is not included in this repository due to its large size. However, you can obtain the dataset from various sources such as the UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle.
